                <h3>Slime Time Live</h3>
                <p>"Slime Time Live" was Nickelodeons live television gameshow that aired from 2000-2003. The show consisted of an audience of Universal Themepark visitors, and various Nickolodeon stars competing in challenges and getting slimed.</p>

                <h3>The Worst Audience Members of All Time</h3>
                <p>The trip started off as an ordinary visit to Disney and Universal themeparks my family did every other year. I was 7 years old. 
                My parents surprised my older brother and I with "Slime Time Live" tickets the day we entered Universal. We were pretty pumped, being 
                pretty big fans of the show and all. When the time came my brother and I were led inside and sat in our assigned seats. This is
                when we discovered the entire live genre of TV is fraud. They held up signs telling us when to applaud and laugh. Being the ignorant
                kids that we were, we had a fantastic idea that would eventually lead to us being removed from the theme park. My older brother was 13
                at the time, and he told me when the camera panned back over us and they told us to applaud, hold up my middle fingers. I had no idea
                what it meant, but he said it'd be funny. It only took a single time. They noticed us almost immediately. We were escorted out and our parents
                 were called over intercom.</p>

                <h3>Kicked Out</h3>
                <p>I'm assuming you can probably guess what came next. We were escorted to an office building and sat with a Park Director.
                    He told us to leave, very kindly might i add considering what had happened. He understood we were young and stupid. On the
                    other hand, my parent's sure didn't understand. They were livid, as any parents would be. The rest of the day was filled with
                    tension, but fortunately went away the next with the start to our Disney visits. </p>

                <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
                <p>Well I'm sure you're wondering what actually aired? So were we. When it finally primeired we all took a seat to see how
                    Nickolodeon had saved this one, because your section was guarunteed to be featured on TV at least once. And it was, but when
                    our section was panned over, there was zero cheering or applause. It was literally just us taking our seats. Not sure why, but we
                    still find it hilarious we ruined a live TV segment for thirty other kids that were also featured on TV doing nothing related to 
                    the actual events currently taking place in the episode. Oh well, it was a bad show anyway. </p>
